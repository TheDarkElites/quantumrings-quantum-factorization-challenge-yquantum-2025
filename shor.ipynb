In 2012, the integer 21 was factorized, as of 2020, this is the largest number reliably factored using Shor’s algorithm <sup>[3](#f3)</sup>. There are several other claims of large numbers being factorized using classical-quantum hybrid methods.\n",

    "The algorithm uses two banks of qubit registers. The upper bank is called the source register, and the lower bank is called the target register. The oracle function performs modular exponentiation on the source register and stores the values in the target register. This process is done in one step using quantum parallelism.\n",

This assumption creates a sufficiently large state-space in the source register, which can contain even the longest periods.By having a large value of $ s $, we can explore a dense solution space, and the period $ r $ can be estimated as accurately as possible.The modular exponentiation circuits require additional qubits to store intermediate information. Hence, we have selected that the target register is also made of $ s $ qubits.\n",
    "Some preprocessing tasks are required before the algorithm is started. First, we need to check whether $ N $ is a prime number.There are some classical methods to do the primality check, and it can be done efficiently on a classical computer. The second task is to identify $ a $ and confirm that $ N $ and $ a $ are coprime.The third task is to determine the number of qubits required. After completing these steps, the circuit can be constructed for execution.\n",
