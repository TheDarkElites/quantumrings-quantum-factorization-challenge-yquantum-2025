## What it does
  This program is an attempt to factor large semi-primes using a general Shor's algorithm utilizing qiskit and quantum rings as 
our backend, written in Python. In practice, we were too novice to develop a working general shors algorithm, even with the additional 
qbit count provided by quantum rings. While this program will run and output an impressive looking graph, the counts themselves seem erroneous 
and are ineffective in identifying the period (r), and the circuit itself is overly complicated and unoptimized. 
## How we built it
  Prototyping in qbraid with a development cycle that at the 2am mark turned into feeding error messages and stack traces into chatgpt in an attempt to get the program to run.
## Challenges we ran into
  Our incredible lack of knowledge about more complex quantum computing, such as general modulus operations embedded as quantum circuits.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
  It dosent error and outputs a count where the shots are not all measured as zeros. If you graph it it almost looks impressive.
## What we learned
  A surprisingly large amount about quantum computing, quantum circuits, and how far we can go without sleep.
## What's next for Large number factorization through Quantum Rings
  A very long nap.
